# TokyoBeddings E-commerce Project
 In this project, my main focus was the javascript aspect where the user is able to add, remove and add up all items(total) in the cart. tools used: html5,css3, and vanilla javascript with web storage such that if the user leaves the page, their items would still be stored there when they reload the page
